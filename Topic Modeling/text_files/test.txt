Mental fitness has very little to do with IQ and intelligence and more to do with positivity and thinking in right direction.Physical HealthPhysical well being is of utmost importance. This is because it is most visible compared to all the other dimensions of health such as social, intellectual, emotional, spiritual and environmental well being.
