It is common for the cancer patients to have undergone treatment for other diseases before finally being diagnosed with cancer. A subset of neoplasms is formed in individuals suffering from cancer. A neoplasm, commonly referred to as tumor, is basically a group of cells that undergo abnormal growth to the extent to form a lump. Some of the common causes of cancer include stress, lack of physical activity, pollution, infections, radiations, diet, tobacco and obesity. In 5-10% of the cases, this disease is inherited.

Prolonged constipation, diarrhea, pain while passing stool/ urine, blood in urine or any other change in the bladder function or bowel movement may also be a sign of cancer. A prolonged sore that does not show any sign of healing must also not be ignored. It may be a sign of skin cancer. One inside the mouth may be a symptom of oral cancer. Lump formation near the breast or the thickening of breast may be a sign of breast cancer. Conclusion With the disease spreading like wild fire with millions of people being affected by it each year, it is imperative for you to learn how to prevent it and ensure that you do not ignore any of the symptoms if they happen to crop up. Be aware, be safe! Cancer is nothing but an unusual growth of cancer cells in any part of the body. Certain body parts are more prone to developing these cells. If not treated on time, these can spread to the other parts of the body. While most cancers are deadly, especially if detected at a later stage, the good news is that you can prevent this problem. Ways to Prevent Cancer Prevention is always better than cure. So here are a few ways in which you can prevent this condition: The health benefits of drinking plentiful water are known to all. This is especially helpful in bringing down the risk of bladder cancer as water can dilute the concentration of agents causing cancer and flush them. Have at least 8 glasses of water each day. The water must be filtered and clean. A healthy diet is no doubt the key to a healthy lifestyle. Have a healthy diet loaded with various fruits, vegetables, cereals and pulses to lower the risk of developing various kinds of cancers. It is suggested to go for the greenest varieties of the green vegetables as these are rich in magnesium that lowers the risk of cancer. It particularly reduces the risk of colon cancer in women. These are loaded with selenium that is said to reduce the risk of developing bladder, lung and colorectal cancer. It is a good idea to have a handful of these in between your meals instead of hogging on unhealthy snacks. As per a research, those who have 5 or more cups of caffeinated coffee each day have a lower chance of developing brain, oral and throat cancer compared to those who drink less. The importance of exercising has been stressed upon time and again. Besides offering numerous other health benefits, indulging in moderate exercise regularly helps in lowering the risk of developing various types of cancers. A recent research shows that filling the fuel tank to the top can thwart the pump’s vapour recovery system which is created to keep the toxic cancer causing air out. Apart from inculcating these healthy habits, it is important to steer clear of tobacco consumption and lower your alcohol intake. Conclusion As per the researchers, around 70% of the known causes of cancers are related to lifestyle and can be avoided with little effort. It is essential to make it a habit to follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly to stay fit and prevent this vicious condition. Cancer occurs due to abnormal cell growth that typically occurs in any one part of the body and spreads to others if not treated on time. There are numerous types of cancers. Some of the common types of cancers include lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, skin cancer, kidney cancer and blood cancer. Millions of people incur this deadly disease each year. While some fight it back bravely others succumb to it after some time. Stages of Cancer There are four stages of cancer. If detected at an early stage, it can be cured with the help of surgery and medication however when detected at a later stage it usually proves fatal for the patient. Here is a detailed look at the four stages of cancer: In stage one, the cancer is small and is still contained within the organ it sprung up in. The size of the tumour is larger in stage 2 however it hasn’t yet begun to spread in the surrounding tissues. At times stage 2 of cancer means that the cancer cells have gone further and spread in the lymph nodes near the tumour. The tumour is much larger in this stage and it may have begun spreading in the surrounding tissues. Cancer cells also spread in the lymph nodes in the area in this stage. In this stage, the cancer has spread to other organ/ organs. It is also referred to as secondary or metastatic cancer. Sometimes these stages are further divided by the use of letters A, B and C. Why is Staging Essential? It is essential to diagnose the cancer stage as it helps in understanding the treatment required for the patient. For instance, if a patient is still in the first stage of cancer then a surgery or radiotherapy may help cure the same. It is a local treatment that only treats one part of the body. If the cancer cells have broken from the original place and entered the lymph nodes which means the patient has entered the third stage of cancer then adjuvant treatment is suggested. This usually involves chemotherapy post surgery. This is done to kill the cancer cells broken away from the primary tumour. In case the cancer has spread to other parts of the body then local and adjuvant treatments are not enough. It requires a treatment that covers the entire body. Such a treatment is known as systemic treatment. It involves chemotherapy hormone therapy and biological therapies that circulate in the bloodstream. Staging is thus used as a means to describe the size of the cancer and the severity of the problem. A number of tests are carried out by the doctors when a patient is diagnosed of cancer. These are done to understand the size of the cancer and whether it has spread to the other organs. This helps in identifying the stage of cancer a patient is suffering from. Conclusion Many types of cancers are curable if detected at stage 1 or 2. However, it becomes difficult to deal with the problem as the stage goes up. The symptoms of this disease must not be ignored and the patient must undergo treatment while there is still time.  Cancer, considered to be a deadly disease, is caused due to various factors including unhealthy lifestyle, exposure to pollution, stress, exposure to radiations, infections, consumption of tobacco and unhealthy dietary choices. There are numerous types of cancers that impact the human body and the cause of their development varies based on their type. Types of Cancers While there are more than 100 types of cancers that can affect the human body here is a look at the some of the most common types and learn a few important points about the same: Conclusion It is suggested to follow a healthy lifestyle by indulging in regular exercise and following a nutritious diet plan to prevent this problem. A person with good immune system is less likely to develop this disease compared to someone with a poor lifestyle and weak immunity.

Yoga comes from the Sanskrit word, ‘YUJ’. It means to join, connect or unite. It is the union of individual consciousness with universal consciousness. Yoga is 5000 years old Indian philosophy. It was first mentioned in the oldest sacred text – The Rig Veda (Vedas were a collection of texts containing mantras, spiritual information, songs and rituals to be used by Brahmins, the Vedic priests. Yoga is being practiced in the Indian society since thousands of years. A person doing yoga will move from one posture to the other called Asana. Yoga benefits people who practice it regularly. The form of exercises performed in Yoga is called as ‘Asana’ which are capable of bringing about stability of body and mind. Yoga Asana are the simplest and easiest way to reduce our excess weight and keep fit. ORIGIN OF YOGA Yoga originated in ancient India thousands of years ago, long before the first religion or belief system was born. It is believed that Shiva is the first Yogi or Adiyogi and the first guru. Thousands of years ago, on the banks of Lake Kantisarovar in Himalayas, Adiyogi shared his knowledge into legendary seven sages as it was hard to put all his wisdom and knowledge in one person. The sages took this powerful yogic science to various parts of the world, including Asia, North Africa, Middle East, and South America. India is blessed to have found the yogic system in its fullest expression. The fossil remains of Indus-Saraswati civilization are an evidence of the presence of Yoga in ancient India. This presence finds a mention in the folk traditions. It is included in the Indus valley civilization, Buddhist and Jain traditions. According to the studies, Yoga was being practiced under the direct guidance of a Guru and its spiritual value was given a lot of importance. Sun was given the highest importance during Vedic period and that’s how Suryanamaskar was invented later on. However, Maharishi Patanjali is known as the father of Modern Yoga. He did not invent Yoga as it was already there in various forms. He assimilated it into the system. He saw that it was getting quite complex for anyone to understand it in any meaningful way. So he assimilated and included all aspects into a certain format – Yoga Sutras. The role of breath is very important in the practice of Asana or Yoga positions. Breath is a vital force and our body requirement of oxygen changes depending on our actions. If we exercise then we require more oxygen hence the breathing becomes faster and if we are relaxing then our breathing becomes relaxed and deep. In yoga, the focus is integrated on breath while indulging in slow movements as well as while doing complete Asana. Yoga promotes smooth and relaxed inhalation and exhalation during the practice. Conclusion Yoga is only partially understood as being limited to Asana. But people fail to realize the immense benefits Yoga offers in uniting the body, mind and breath. Yoga can be opted and practiced by any age group and any body size. It is possible for anyone to start. The size and the fitness level don’t matter as there are modifications for every yoga asana according to different people.  Yoga postures have always been an important discussion in yogic culture. In some yoga schools situated abroad, yoga postures are classified as Standing, Sitting, Lying on back and Lying on Stomach but the actual and traditional classification of Yoga include four main paths including Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Kriya Yoga. Classification of Yoga Here is a look at the four main paths of yoga in brief to understand their importance. Conclusion A Yoga guru or teacher can teach appropriate combination of the four fundamental paths as it is necessary for each seeker. Ancient sayings have stressed that it is essential to work under the directions of a Guru to attain the above mentioned Yoga paths. "
"Happiness is something which is difficult to describe in words. It can only be felt. Happiness is essential for leading a good life but unfortunately it is missing from the lives of most people these days. Different people have different ideas of happiness. Some believe that it can be found in money, others feel happy and content when they are in a good relationship yet others feel elated when they are doing well professionally. Here are essays on happiness of varying lengths to help you with the topic in your exam. You can select any happiness essay according to your need: Happiness is a very simple term which is used commonly. Even a small kid can tell the meaning of happiness. But how many of us really know the meaning of true happiness and how to attain that state? Not many! Most people look for happiness outside. They believe that they can be happy if they possess certain things or be with certain people or reach a professional height. This is what they have been fed with since their childhood. While all the mentioned things are essential for a good living, they cannot bring happiness. Happiness is something that only you can bring for yourself. If you choose to be happy and channelize for thoughts accordingly, then you shall attain happiness. However, it is not as simple as it seems. You need to make efforts to work on it. Secondly, it is not a one-time activity. You need to practice certain things daily in order to achieve this state. Now, while you need to look for happiness inside at times you need to seek help from your family and friends. Many people these days suffer from depression because they choose to deal with their problems on their own and not to involve others. This is wrong! It is important to look within to find true happiness but it is equally important to surround yourself with positive people.  Happiness is a state of bliss. If you train your brain to stay in this state it will stay this way. This is because your mind believes whatever you say. However, it is not as simple as it seems. You may experience happiness from time to time however it may take months or even years to make this state last. Ways to Attract Happiness and Make it Last As per some recent studies, some of the habits to attract happiness and make it last are as follows: Instead of getting super excited or depressed in different situations you must practice to transform these activated feelings into deactivated feelings such as calmness and contentment. These feelings are healthier and also easier to sustain. You must stop thinking about your past mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes; nobody is perfect. Stop blaming yourself or feeling guilty for all the bad decisions you have taken in life. Also stop worrying about your future. Live in the present moment. Don’t let the good times go unnoticed. Remember all your past moments and decisions that brought happiness and rejoice them. Be thankful to God for bestowing such joyous moments. Your thoughts build your reality. Positive thoughts and positive mind attract positive things in life and negative thoughts fetch similar experiences. So the only way to experience happiness is to feel good about all that you have. Steer clear from people who indulge in negative talks or de-motivate you. Surround yourself with positive minds instead. Conclusion It is easy to get carried away by negative thoughts and get into a state of anxiety and stress owing to several things in life. However, you must always remind yourself of the good times and all the things you should be thankful about. This is a good way to shift your mood from negative to positive. Happiness is basically a state of being happy and content. Several philosophers have given different views on this topic however the most dominant one is that happiness comes from within and must not be searched for in the outside world. Money Cannot Buy Happiness It is sad how people look for happiness outside. Many people associate happiness with money. If this was the case then rich people would have never felt sad. But on the contrary, we see that it is the rich who seem more anxious, fearful, stressed and often experience relationship problems and suffer from depression. Celebrities such as movie stars, singers and ministers have hoards of money and yet the divorce rate of these people is much higher than the general public. These people live in constant fear of being chased or hit and hence require security all the time. They are more fearful about the safety of their children. They are also the ones more prone to theft and robbery. Many of them have so much overflow of wealth that they are constantly stressed about where to invest or hide it. On the other hand, those belonging to the poor classes are often more carefree and joyous. This is not to say that being rich is a bad thing. Having money means that you have access to a lot of things. You can go on holidays, plan social gatherings, purchase good clothes, buy properties, live in a good locality and a lot more and all this brings in a feel good factor which is an essential component for being happy. However, believing that if you have all these you will be happy is wrong. Materialistic things can make you happy momentarily but cannot help attain true happiness. Happiness Comes from Within It is rightly said, “You will find true happiness in life when you realize it only takes “you” to be happy. True happiness lies within yourself, it doesn’t come from others”. This point has been emphasized at several places. But most people dismiss it as irrelevant. It needs to be understood that happiness is basically a state of mind. It cannot be achieved from things we see outside. We have the power to create it with the help of positive emotions which can be achieved with good thoughts. Conclusion It is basically our thoughts that create our emotions. So we need to work upon building positive thoughts and a positive outlook towards life and it would ultimately result in true happiness. Happiness is something that everyone craves for but very few are able to attain. As simple as it is to define, it is equally difficult to achieve it. This is because people often associate it with people and things. Happiness is something that begins and ends with you. Only those who realize this shall be able to attain true happiness. Aristotle’s Philosophy about Happiness Aristotle was one such philosopher who wrote at length about happiness. He believed that happiness depends on our own self. As per him, happiness is the main purpose of human life. He stated that happiness is a goal in itself and that it depends on virtue. However, Aristotle’s virtues are more individualistic rather than being typically social virtues. As per Aristotle, a truly happy life needs the fulfillment of many conditions such as being physically and mentally fit. He has presented the theory of happiness in one of his most influential works, Nicomachean Ethics. This theory of Aristotle holds relevance even in today’s scenario. As per him, happiness is the end that meets all the needs. He states that almost everything we desire, be it good relationships, money, success or power is because we believe that these will make us happy. This is to say that everything else is just a means towards attaining happiness and happiness is an end in itself. Happiness in a Relationship Many people associate happiness with money and several others associate it with relationships. What they do not understand is that they can never truly be happy in a relationship if they are not happy with themselves. Relationship problems have been growing rapidly and the main reason behind this is that we expect too much from the other person. We expect them to make us feel happy. We feed our brain with lies such as, ‘we shall be happy if our partner buys us this dress’ or ‘we shall be happy if our partner plans a surprise for us’. The problem is not just with couples. It is the same with every relationship be it a parent-child relationship, brother-sister relationship or friendship. Here are a few ways to help develop healthy and happy relationships: Take good care of yourself. Do not give priority to the other person over yourself and let him do the same. If you give too much and do not get anything in return you are creating a recipe for disappointment. If you want to go somewhere then plan it yourself. Do not wait for your partner or parent or child to take you there. Tell them you would love it if they come along. However, if they refuse do not get disheartened. Continue with your plan. It is essential to give space to your partner and demand your personal space in a relationship to build a healthy relationship. Conclusion We set unrealistic expectations from other people in our life and believe that if they truly love us they would act in a certain manner. This is absolutely wrong. This only harms the relationship rather than doing any good. It needs to be understood that the only person who can make you feel truly happy is you.  Happiness is a way of life and not something that can be achieved and kept. People spend their entire life running after happiness but end up dissatisfied. They are conditioned to believe that they will be happy if they get admission in a good college or if they secure a good job or if they get an understanding life partner. While all these help in building a good life which is essential to attain happiness however these alone cannot bring happiness. Happiness is something that comes from within and not from external things. Happiness as per Buddhism As per Buddhism, “Happiness does not depend on what you have or who you are. It solely relies on what you think.” Buddha believed that happiness begins from understanding the main causes of suffering. He has given an Eightfold path following which helps control the mind and ultimately leads to happiness. However, this is not a one-time task. This needs to be followed daily. The idea is to teach your mind not to dwell in the past or worry about future and to live in the present. The here and now is the only place where you can experience peace and happiness. Buddha has been described as “ever-smiling”. His portrayals mostly depict him with a smile. This smile comes from a profound composure from within. Buddhism states that true happiness can be attained by knowledge and practice to develop mental calmness and this can be achieved by detaching oneself from the needs, wants and passions. Happiness as per Hinduism As per Hinduism, happiness is attained by way of one’s own actions, past deeds and the grace of God. Three types of happiness have been mentioned in the Hindu scriptures. These are as follows: The ultimate aim of a living being as per Hinduism is to experience supreme blissfulness as a free soul in the heaven. The human beings can experience temporary happiness on earth by fulfilling their duties however permanent happiness according to Hinduism can only be achieved in the heaven by attaining liberation. Happiness – Essential for Good Life Whether you are a student, a working professional, a housewife or a retired person – happiness is something that is essential for each one of you to lead a good life. It is necessary for a person’s emotional well being. If a person is not healthy emotionally, his overall health is likely to do down the drain in no time. Unfortunately, even though happiness is extremely essential, people do not pay much attention to ways in which they can keep themselves happy. They are all so engrossed in their professional lives and other nitty-gritty’s of life that they forget to enjoy the good moments in life. No wonder, the cases of stress, anxiety and depression are rising by the day. Conclusion The definition of happiness and the perspective of seeing and pursuing it may be different as per different institutions however the sole meaning of it is to be in a joyous state. As hard as you work to earn and maintain your lifestyle, if you work equally hard to attain happiness, your life would be much better. "
"Health refers to a person’s physical, mental and social well being. A person is said to be enjoying good health when he is devoid of any physical ailments, mental stress and enjoys good interpersonal relationships.

It includes being mentally and emotionally strong, possessing healthy inter-personal relationships, having good cognitive skills and being spiritually awakened. Being healthy is not a state; it is a way of life. It is a process. Keeping your physical health in check requires you to have proper diet every day. You cannot have nutritious diet for two days a week and hog on junk for the rest and still be healthy. Similarly, you cannot sleep for 24 hours on the same day and stay awake for the next three days. It is essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle to stay in good shape and enjoy good health. In addition to having a rich diet full of nutrients one must also have adequate sleep and exercise on a daily basis to maintain health. It is also essential to surround oneself with people who bring in positivity and encourage you to bring out the best in you rather than pulling you down.

It’s also about what you’re thinking and saying.” Generally, a person is said to be enjoying good health when he is mentally and physically fit. However, health has more to it. The modern definition of health includes various other aspects that need to be kept intact to enjoy a healthy life. How the Definition of Health Evolved? Initially, health only meant the body’s ability to function well. It was only disrupted because of physical ailment or disease. It was in 1948 that the World Health Organization (WHO) associated the term health with a person’s overall physical, mental as well as social well being and not just the absence of ailment. While this definition was accepted by some, it was largely criticized. It was said that this definition of health was extremely broad and thus seemed rather vague. It was discarded as being impractical for a long time. 1980’s brought a new concept of health. It stated health as a resource for living and not just a state. Today, a person is considered healthy if he is enjoying good physical, mental, social, spiritual and cognitive health. Importance of Maintaining Health Good health forms the basis for accomplishing various other tasks in life. Here is how it helps: Family Life: Somebody who is physically unfit cannot take care of his family. Similarly, someone experiencing mental stress and having the inability to handle his emotions cannot build and promote good family relations. Work: It goes without saying that a physically unfit person cannot work properly. Good mental health is equally essential for working efficiently. To get recognition at work one must also enjoy good social and cognitive health. Studies: Poor physical and mental health is a hindrance in studying. It is important to maintain good cognitive health in addition to good physical and mental health to study well. Conclusion It is essential to take utmost care of your health. It is only when you are healthy you would be able to take good care of other aspects of your life. Health is the name given to the state where a person is physically and mentally fit, has good interpersonal relationships and is spiritually awakened. One must take utmost care of every aspect of his health to enjoy a wholesome living. Techniques to Optimize Health Here are a few simple techniques to help optimize health: The first step towards maintaining good health is to have a diet rich in various micronutrients. Your diet must especially include fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables. Also have pulses, eggs and dairy products that help in your overall growth and cereals that render energy to keep you going throughout the day. It is essential to give your body adequate rest to stay healthy and retain energy to work. Sleeping for 8 hours a day is a must for this. In no case should you compromise on your sleep. Lack of sleep leaves you lethargic and drains you both physically and mentally. It is suggested to take out at least half an hour from your daily schedule to indulge in any physical exercise of your choice. You may try brisk walking, jogging, swimming, cycling, yoga or any other exercise of your choice. This keeps you physically fit and is also a great way to relax your mind. As important as it is for you to indulge in physical exercise, it is equally important for you to play brain games. These are good for your cognitive health. Meditation is a great way to calm your mind and sit in self introspection. It takes you to a higher state and gives more clarity of thoughts. It is essential for you to surround yourself with positive people. Be with those with whom you can indulge in healthy and meaningful discussions and also those who bring out the best in you rather than discouraging you. This is good for your emotional as well as social health. It is a good idea to enrol for annual health check-up. Precaution is always better than cure. So if you see any kind of deficiencies or any such issue in the report you can seek medical help and cure it just in time before it escalates. Conclusion Today, people are so caught up in the rat race that they forget to take care of their health. It is essential to understand that health comes first. One must follow the aforementioned points to optimize health and live joyfully. Health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being. Health is of prime importance and everything else comes later. Maintaining good health depends on a number of factors including the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the kind of people we deal with and the amount of exercise we indulge in. Mental Health is as Important as Physical Health While a lot of importance is given on being physically fit from a person’s early years itself, many people overlook the need and importance to stay emotionally and mentally strong. It is time people should understand how important it is to maintain mental health and work in that direction. Parents are often seen giving importance to the food their children should eat and the level of hygiene that needs to be maintained to ensure their physical health. Many moms are seen showing concern over their children’s eating habits. They force their children to have food using different means to keep them physically fit and energetic. But we have seldom seen anyone who pays as much attention to understand as to what is going on in their child’s mind. Parents often give instructions to their kids to get tasks done but do not try to analyse as to why their child is avoiding or denying something. Spending time with children and catering to their emotional needs is as important as feeding them. This does not only hold good for children but for people of every age. Each individual should give as much importance to his mental and emotional health as he gives to his physical well being. It is the lack of this that is giving rise to problems such as depression, hypertension and stress. Healthcare in India There is no National health insurance system for the citizens of India. This is the reason why the private sector is the main healthcare provider in the country. While there are government hospitals at many places in the country where the diagnoses is done for free and people are also given access to free medicines, many people hesitate visiting these facilities due to lack of hygiene. Also, since these offer free services there is a lot of waiting here. The government must work upon maintaining these facilities and should also set up more of these so that the needs of every citizen can be catered to. The common man in India requires bearing huge healthcare expenses. Most of the savings made by them are spent in taking care of their family’s health. Those who buy healthcare insurance also need to spend amount from their pocket when it comes to undergoing various treatments as there are loopholes in these policies. Conclusion There is so much competition at every step in life. Each person wants to outshine the other, be it at the school or college level or at maintaining a lifestyle later in life and their health takes a backseat. People must recognize the fact that health comes first. It is only when we are healthy we can work better on other aspects in life. The government must also provide good healthcare facilities for the betterment of the country.  Health was initially known as a state in which a person was mentally and physically fit. It was said to be disrupted when a person fell sick or suffered from other physical ailments. However, over the decades, the definition of health has undergone change and it covers a broader perspective now. Different Components of Health There are basically five components of health. A person is considered to be healthy when all these are in check. Here is a look at these components: Physical Health is being physically fit, devoid of any illness or disease. Good physical health promotes longer life span. How to Maintain Physical Health? It includes the psychological and emotional well being of a person. Our mental health basically impacts the way we feel, think and handle different situations. Keeping mental health in check is as important as keeping physical health intact. How to Maintain Mental and Emotional Health? Social health is a person’s ability to build and maintain satisfying interpersonal relationships with his/ her friends, neighbours, relatives and others in the society. It also refers to a person’s ability to act appropriately and adapt to different social situations. How to Maintain Social Health? When a person’s brain can perform all the mental processes efficiently he/ she is said to enjoy good cognitive health. The processes and activities involve learning new things, good judgement, efficient use of language to communicate your point and strong intuition. How to Maintain Cognitive Health? It is basically establishing a sense of connection with a person’s inner self to understand the meaning of life. Keeping the spiritual health intact helps a person become more positive, patient and sorted in life. How to Maintain Spiritual Health? What is Cultural Health? It is basically an education discipline that educates about the appropriate cultural information. It refers to intra or inter-cultural competence which is required to establish effective cross-cultural communication. This is divided into four categories: Conclusion Health doesn’t only mean your physical and mental health it comprises of various other elements as discussed above. While good physical health lays the basis for a healthy life, you must keep all the other health components intact to enjoy a wholesome life.

Our company and circumstances usually play an important role in it. People are aware about the consequences before they indulge in such habits but still they do. For instance, people know that drugs are not good for them and it is highly likely to get addicted to them. But many a times they feel the urge to try these just out of curiosity or to heal their pain temporarily thinking that they would just have it once or twice but soon get addicted to them. Likewise, people are aware that once they begin playing a video game in between their office hours they will get addicted and wouldn’t be able to stop but they still play and end up ruining their time. Overcoming any kind of addiction is quite difficult – be it drug addiction, mobile addiction, gambling addiction, social media addiction or shopping addiction.

Many people return to their addiction after weeks, months or years of recovery just because it works as an escape for them. It is thus suggested to avoid these in the first place. Stay away from such chronic habits to live a healthy and fulfilling life.  Introduction Addiction is something that can make us lose interest in everything around us and keep us glued to one particular thing. This particular thing can be a drug, mobile, internet, food item, gambling or just about anything. Addiction to anything can have an adverse effect on our life. Causes of Addiction Drugs, alcohol, mobile phones, social media, excessive shopping, eating our favourite food all help in bursting stress and provide an escape from pain. People indulge in these to get rid of pain temporarily. These habits can turn into addiction if we don’t guard ourselves on time. Our company and social environment have a huge impact on our habits and overall personality. If we socialise with people who party every other day and drink heavily, we are also likely to develop that habit. Likewise, if your friends have the habit of shopping excessively you are also likely to develop that habit. At times, people do not have knowledge about the consequence of indulging in a particular game or having a certain substance. They indulge in it just for fun and then get addicted to it. Ways to Avoid Addiction Avoiding addiction of any kind is easier than getting rid of the habit later. Here is how you can do so: Conclusion Addiction to anything has a negative impact on our mind as well as body. We must thus identify the causes of addiction of different kinds and avoid them by taking the aforementioned measures. Introduction Addiction is defined as a complex brain condition that may be caused by overindulgence in a particular habit or thing. As Patrick Carnes said, “Addiction is a relationship, a pathological relationship in which obsession replaces people”. Obsessing over anything is termed as addiction to that particular thing. Addiction to anything – be it drugs, internet, social media or gaming can have fatal consequences. Addiction to Anything is Bad Different people get addicted to different things. Some may be obsessed with a person and thus get addicted to talking to him or being with him all the time, some may be obsessed with their own self and may get addicted to taking selfies and boasting about themselves on the social media, some may be obsessed with shopping and may get addicted to visiting markets and malls to buy unnecessary stuff. Our company and circumstances usually play an important role in developing such addictions. Even though people know about the harmful consequences of addiction, they are unable to stop themselves from indulging in the same. Addiction to drugs is the worst kind of addiction. People usually develop this habit in their youth and even after trying hard they aren’t able to get rid of it later in life. Many treatments have been developed to overcome drug addiction. However, if a person does not follow self control no amount of therapies or treatments can help him get rid of it. Addiction Free India Numerous youths in India are addicted to alcohol and drugs. This takes a toll on both their mental and physical health. Drug addiction does not only harm the addict but his entire family suffers with him. Besides, a person’s professional life also goes for a toss due to this habit. While on the one hand, we talk about empowering our youth and hope that they will contribute towards the development of our country on the other hand we see thousands of youths ruining their lives due to addiction to drugs and alcohol. The youth must be sensitized towards this issue. The government must also play its part by putting a ban on the sale of such substances to put a stop to these practices. Anyone seen selling these illegally must be severely punished. Conclusion It is time to act responsibly and say no to drugs or for that matter to addiction of any kind. The government or our friends and family members cannot help much if we are not ready to help ourselves. Introduction Addiction of any kind can have an adverse effect on the victim as well as those close to him. It is said that, “Addiction is a family disease. One person may use, but the whole family suffers”. Consequences of Addiction Here is a brief look at the consequences of addiction: The health hazards associated with drug and alcohol addiction are known to all.

You are so obsessed with it that you do not realise that you are over spending. It can dig a hole in your pocket and your budget can go for a toss. Those addicted to gambling, drugs and alcohol mostly borrow money to quench their addiction and often end up in debt. People addicted to drugs and alcohol often lose their sense of control and end up indulging in unnecessary arguments and conflicts with those around them thereby straining their relationships. Those addicted to social media and internet are so engrossed in their mobile that they ignore and neglect their family members. Those having gambling addiction are frustrated most of the times and this affects their relationships negatively. Addiction also hampers ones studies and work life.

Those trying hard to get rid of addiction of any sort can try the following: Conclusion Addiction to anything influences our decisions and choices.

This has negative repercussions on our relationships as well as work. It is suggested to avoid these in the first place however if you develop some kind of addiction, you can get rid of them with the help of aforementioned tips.  Introduction The term addiction is often associated with drugs. However, this is not the only kind of addiction, a person can get addicted to numerous other things. This may include addiction to food, addiction to video games, addiction to mobile, addiction to the internet, addiction to social media, shopping addiction and gambling addiction to name a few. Types of Addiction Here is a brief look at the common types of addictions: Food Addiction Many people get addicted to the taste of certain foods such as some special kind of chips or burger from a particular restaurant or pizza of a special flavour or noodles or just about anything. Some people are addicted to eating spicy food so they can have anything which is spicy. Likewise, some people have a sweet tooth and thus crave for sweets all the time. The addiction is so much so that even if they are not hungry they still crave for such foods and overeat. Most of the food items people are addicted to are unhealthy. Overeating and over indulging in unhealthy food habits can be hazardous for health. Mobile and Video Game Addiction Everyone these days is glued to mobile phones. We are constantly on our phones, texting, calling and surfing endlessly. We are so engrossed in it that we forget the people around us. Many gaming sites have been developed these days and most games on these sites are extremely addictive. People these days can be seen playing games such as Candy Crush constantly on their mobile phones and laptops. This mobile and video game addiction does not only strain our personal relationships but also hampers our work. Internet and Social Media Addiction Surfing the internet has also become an addiction for some. Social media platforms have further aggravated this addiction. We want to show off everything we do to the world. We are so caught up with recording the moments to propagate that we are having fun that we actually forget to have fun. Taking selfies is another addiction that people have developed these days. Drug and Alcohol Addiction This is the worst kind of addiction as it can impact your mental as well as physical health adversely. Also drug and alcohol addiction is very hard to get rid of. Drug addicts often develop serious health problems. However, they are not able to leave this addiction even though they know the consequences. Heroin, Cocaine, Marijuana, Hallucinogens and Crack are some of the common types of drugs that are used get into that feeling of ecstasy for a short while. Shopping Addiction Many people develop the habit of spending money on things they don’t even need. They see shopping as a way to release their stress. It gives them a different sort of pleasure and to experience the same they indulge in it regularly. For some, it becomes addiction. They go on shopping sprees even though they do not require anything. They keep buying stuff not only for themselves but for anyone and everyone they know. Gambling Addiction Once a person starts gambling, he cannot leave the habit easily. Whether he wins or loses, he is drawn to indulge in it time and again. This soon becomes an addiction. Gambling has ruined the personal and professional life of many around the world. Casinos and bars take advantage of this weakness of people and make profitable business. Conclusion The irony is that even though people know that over indulging in anything can lead to its addiction however they still cannot stop themselves from doing so. We must take control of our life and avoid these harmful habits so that they don’t take charge of our life eventually. "
"Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS is a syndrome that, as the name suggests, weakens the body’s immune system. The infection is caused by a virus known as Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV and is transmitted through unprotected sex, use of needles already exposed to the virus, transfusion of unscreened blood and through gestation from an infected mother to her child. Below you will find essays on AIDS, its causes, symptoms, treatments and prevention. These essays are of different lengths and should prove useful in your exams. Choose the essay {you need} as per your requirement. Introduction Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS is a pervasive disease that is caused by HIV or Human Immunodeficiency Virus attacking the immune system of the human body. It has no known cure although there are medicines to slow down or completely inhibit the virus spread. Since one of the main methods of transfer of the virus is through unprotected sex, AIDS also carries with it a stigma that ensures that society didn’t discuss it openly for a long time. Unfortunately, this taboo meant that not enough information was being shared about how the disease spread, since most people were wary of talking about it. Combine the lack of a cure with this lack of information in public forums and you get a pandemic that has resulted in over 28.9 million deaths. Importance of Awareness There is only one way to fight the spread of AIDS and that is through creating awareness. Ignorance of is the causes and methods of transfer of HIV and it only makes a bad situation fully worse. It is imperative, therefore, that people be made aware of what AIDS is, how it spreads and what can be done to prevent infection. Governments and non-profit organizations have instituted various programs not only to do health check-ups but also to dispel the prejudice that attaches itself to this disease and those who suffer from it. Awareness programs have spread information about HIV and how to prevent it for years now and their efforts have borne fruit. The results speak for themselves. The percentage of people with HIV has reduced considerably. So that people do not become complacent and forget that AIDS is still very much a player in the deadly diseases field various awareness initiatives have been undertaken, the most prominent of which is World AIDS Day – a day when people show their solidarity with those who are afflicted with this disease and remember those who were struck down by it. Other initiatives target vulnerable people and communities so that they are fully informed and able to prevent the disease from spreading. Conclusion While new therapies can help in controlling HIV from spreading all over the body, awareness is the key to actually prevent AIDS from spreading across populations. It also helps to remind one that while the pandemic is under control now it is by no means gone and carelessness or apathy will definitely ensure that it comes roaring back.  Introduction AIDS has ended up taking well over 28.9 million lives in the years since the disease was first discovered. Thanks to various myths and misconceptions about the syndrome, the virus spread like wildfire and infected millions of people before it could be contained. The fact that it attacks white blood cells thereby weakening immunity is what makes it so deadly, since it undermines the human body’s defence and leaves people who are HIV positive at massive risk. Thanks to concerted efforts by governments across the world, advancements in medicine and awareness campaigns, the number of HIV positive people has reduced. However, no cure for the disease has been found yet. There are treatments available but they can only inhibit the virus; they can’t eliminate it from the body entirely. In these circumstances, it becomes imperative that we focus on prevention to get to the root of the problem. Preventative Measures In order to prevent AIDS from spreading, we need to first know how it spreads. There are three main ways in which HIV can move around from one person to another – unprotected sexual intercourse with an HIV positive partner, transfer of HIV from mother to child, either during pregnancy or during breast feeding, transfusion of blood and needle sharing amongst drug users. Therefore, any preventative measures need to take these factors into account. Some things that one can do to protect themselves are: Preventive Measures for AIDS  Conclusion Since there is no cure for AIDS at the moment, prevention is definitely better than cure in the case of this disease. Some simple preventative measures can ensure that the spread of the virus is limited if not completely halted.  Introduction The fact that India has the world’s second-largest population is part of the reason that India has the world’s third largest HIV epidemic. In terms of percentage, this statistic is around 0.3 percent, which might not seem too large. However, when this statistic is converted to actual numbers it becomes 2.1 million people who are HIV positive. This number is as per data collected by UNAIDS for the year 2016. AIDS-related causes killed 62,000 people in the same year. At Risk Demographics The most at-risk sections of the population are sex workers, men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs and transgender people. These are some of the most vulnerable groups in society since most of them are subject to discrimination and stigma. That discrimination makes it difficult, if not outright impossible, for them to access healthcare. Add to this the fact that activities associated with sex work such as running a brothel are illegal, gay and bisexual men face social stigma if they come out, drug addicts are generally reviled and transgender people are looked down upon and you have the perfect combination of circumstances that breed an epidemic. Prevention and Treatment Efforts Fortunately, there has been a concerted drive by the UN, the Indian government and various non-profits organizations to reduce the risk that these sections of the populace face.  The number of AIDS testing and counselling sites has gone from only 67 in 1997 to 20,000 in 2016. In addition, HIV awareness campaigns have been ramped up and testing and treatment have been made free. Thanks to these and other measures, the number of people living with HIV has actually gone down from 5.1 million in 2003 to 2.1 million in 2016. New Challenges While the measures put in place have helped in controlling the epidemic, India cannot rest on its laurels. States with larger populations such as Bihar, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan have recently reported infection in new pockets. India needs to expand its policies to reduce harm and to decriminalize homosexuality and drug use so that these sections of society can have access to care and treatment without fear of repercussions. Conclusion We must take care of our health and our health status should be checked out periodically to remain away from this deadly disease. We should also motivate and suggest others to do the same. This disease cannot be eradicated from the society; so, we must focus on its prevention.  Introduction AIDS is a public health issue, perhaps the most important such issue in recorded history. Although the AIDS pandemic reached its peak in 2005 and has declined since, there are still around 37 million people worldwide who are HIV positive. Moreover, as of 2017, AIDS has been responsible for the deaths of 28.9 million to 41.5 million people around the world. Raising awareness about this disease is absolutely vital. This is why the WHO has marked the World AIDS Day as one of eight official global campaigns. What is World AIDS Day? 1st December is the day designated as World AIDS Day, an international day that is meant to spread awareness about AIDS. However, this is not the only reason this day is celebrated. It also allows people who aren’t HIV positive to support and ally with those people who are. It is also a day when those who eventually succumbed to the disease are commemorated. It is the first ever day dedicated to a global public health issue. Importance of World AIDS Day There is no denying the fact that the spread of AIDS isn’t as rampant as it once was. Thanks to awareness campaigns, scientific advances and new treatments we can understand and combat the disease better. However, there is no avoiding the fact that nearly 37 million people are living with this disease and new pockets of infection are being discovered every day. Moreover, people with AIDS are still subjected to discrimination and live in fear of the stigma that the disease carries with it. Therefore, it becomes very important to remind everyone that AIDS is still very much out there; the government and public must continue to spread awareness, raise funds and combat the prejudice and discrimination that people who are HIV positive face. This is why World AIDS Day is celebrated annually as a reminder that AIDS hasn’t gone away. What to do on World AIDS Day/Activities On World AIDS Day, we need to show our support for those who are living with this disease and those who have been struck down by it. One of the most common ways to show solidarity is to wear the HIV Awareness red ribbon. These ribbons can be found in packs of 100 at the online store of the National AIDS Trust or NAT. The order is free but those who buy the packs must show that they will use the ribbons for fundraising. The Trust also sells red ribbon brooches from the online store. Another way to show support is to either organize or participate in World AIDS Day events. Conclusion While the AIDS pandemic has been contained to a certain degree, the disease has still not been eradicated. Until that goal is reached, World AIDS Day needs to continue so that people don’t labour under the misconception that this deadly disease is gone; instead there is awareness about the disease, its prevention and its treatment.  Introduction The AIDS pandemic that, at one time, threatened to spread like wildfire throughout the world’s populations has been checked to some extent. Thanks to determined campaigns worldwide, more people are becoming aware of AIDS – not only how deadly it is but also what causes it and how to treat it. The more information we have, the better we can fight. Therefore, it becomes vital that we know as much as we can about this syndrome to help stop its spread. Causes of AIDS/HIV AIDS is caused by HIV or Human Immunodeficiency Virus. It is a retrovirus, which means that it replicates by inserting a DNA copy of its genome into host cells. In this case, the host cells are white blood cells known as T-helper cells or CD4 cells, which are part of the immune system. HIV destroys these cells and makes copies of itself, thereby, weakening the human immune system. In practical terms, it lowers our ability to fight off diseases over time. This doesn’t mean that every person who is HIV positive has AIDS. However, if treatment is not made available in time, someone who is HIV positive can develop AIDS. Transmission of AIDS/HIV HIV can be transferred in one of three ways: Symptoms of AIDS/HIV HIV doesn’t always have readily identifiable symptoms. However, certain symptoms can show up depending upon how far it has progressed in the body. Once the disease has progressed to the stage where it is more or less full blown AIDS, a patient becomes much more vulnerable to various other diseases such as tuberculosis. Treatment of AIDS or HIV There is no cure for AIDS or HIV at the moment. Since HIV is a retrovirus that replicates by replacing the host cell’s DNA with copies of its own DNA, the best way to contain its spread is ART or antiretroviral therapy. This is a drug therapy that prevents the virus from replicating, thereby slowing or stopping its progress. It is best to start the treatment in the early stages of infection so that the immune system isn’t significantly affected. At later stages, this treatment can be combined with drugs that treat secondary diseases the patient may have contracted due to lowered immunity. Conclusion Being diagnosed as HIV positive isn’t an easy thing to handle. However, with the treatments now available to rein in the spread of the disease, patients suffering from HIV can still lead long, healthy and productive lives.

"Life on this planet is interconnected. Nothing is isolated and everything has an impact on everything else. With concerns about climate change looming and becoming more immediate, we need to understand how our environment and health are connected. Below you will find some essays on environment and human health that can help you in your examinations/assignments. Select any environment and human health essay you need from the ones given below. Introduction Human health is defined as the state of well-being with regards to the mental, physical and social aspects of the human condition. A person cannot be called healthy merely because of the absence of disease; he or she needs to be doing well in all ways to actually qualify as healthy. Many factors play a role in determining our health – biological, nutritional, psychological and chemical. These factors can be influenced by internal and external conditions. Externally, the biggest factor that influences our health is our environment. Environment and Human Health Our environment isn’t merely the air we breathe, although that is a major component; it ranges from the water we drink to the soil we grow our food in to the sounds and noises in our surroundings. Each part affects us and thereby our health. With emissions from vehicles, factories and fires, our air supply is full of toxic chemicals that present the risk of lung cancer, heart disease and asthma. The food we eat is covered in pesticides that make soil less fertile and can be carcinogenic for us. The human body needs water to survive but our water sources are full of human and industrial wastes that create serious health issues. Conclusion We need to remember that we have to live in synergy with our environment. What we put out in it will come back to us. Unless we do something now, the earth will very soon no longer be a habitable planet.  Introduction Human tendency has always been to subjugate our surroundings. We take pleasure in conquering and reshaping our environment as though it is beneath us and we are supreme. However, the simple truth is that humans are as dependent upon the environment as any other animals on the planet for our continued well-being. Therefore, if we harm our environment, we harm ourselves.  Health and Environment Our physical, mental and social well-being is dependent upon our surroundings. What we put into the ecosystem is eventually cycled back to us. The pollutants we discard into this ecosystem find their way back through the air we breathe, the food we consume and the water we drink. Since we discard these pollutants because they are harmful to us, it follows that when we inadvertently consume them afterwards, they will still have harmful effects on our health. Problems with this have been going on for quite some time. We use pesticides on our food crops because the chemicals kill the pests that could destroy the crops. However, those pesticides remain on the food when we consume them causing health problems ranging from skin problems to cancer. The pesticides also reduce the fertility of the soil ensuring that the next crop isn’t as bountiful. Similarly, we discard human and industrial waste into whatever water body is conveniently close. But we also use the same water bodies for drinking water. Water pollution leads to diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, lead poisoning, polio and arsenicosis amongst others. The air is also polluted by all the gaseous emissions our activities release. Ranging from smoke from fires to emissions from vehicles and industries, these pollutants cause respiratory disorders such as asthma and bronchitis and can even result in lung cancer. Conclusion Environmental scientists have been raising the alarm for some time, but things are very critical now. Our unchecked activities have had adverse effects on the ecosystem and some of that damage is now irreversible. If we do not step up to the plate, we will render the earth uninhabitable very soon.  Introduction As per the definition by WHO, “human health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity”. This well-being does not happen in isolation; it is affected by internal as well as external factors. Internal factors include issues inside the human body such as immune deficiencies, hormonal imbalances and genetic or congenital disorders.  External factors generally include three types of health hazards: physical hazards such as ultraviolet and radioactive radiations, noise pollution, carbon monoxide and CFCs; chemical hazards such as industrial effluents, heavy metals, pesticides and fossil fuel combustion; and biological hazards such as parasites, bacteria and viruses. This clearly means that our health is, to a great extent, dependent upon our environment and the environmental factors that affect human health are mostly created by humans. What we release into our eco-system eventually finds its way back to us. How Environment Affects Human Health Since we are completely dependent on the environment to survive, it is safe to say that any changes to the environment will impact human well-being. However, the actual relationship between these two is more complex than we believed and isn’t always easy to assess. The most obvious impacts that we have seen are from deteriorating water quality, air pollution and unsanitary conditions. Radiation poisoning too has deadly consequences for human health. The response to these issues has been an overall attempt to clean up our ecosystem. While that has worked for some countries, mostly in the developed world, it hasn’t been applied thoroughly in the developing countries of the world. Bilateral and multilateral agreements between countries have managed to address some of the more immediate concerns such as the emission of CFCs into the atmosphere and the damage done to the ozone layer by them. The corporate world is also trying to lessen its carbon footprint and turning to ‘green’ solutions. However, there are many concerns that have yet to be addressed and are spiralling out of control such as biodiversity; on an average, one species dies out every day. In addition, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain a proper supply of food so that the world doesn’t starve. Conclusion We are simply too well-woven into our surroundings to be immune to the effects of any changes in those surroundings. The problem is that because the relationship between health and environment is complex, we aren’t motivated to make major changes; we’re waiting for irrefutable evidence. By the time we do get it, it might be too late.  Introduction We are aware of the complex strands that bind us to our environment. We have already started noticing the difference in our health and how it is related to what we do to our environment. However, a point to consider is that if a bad environment can cause harm to human health, a good environment can actually nurture it. Unhealthy Environment Unhealthy Life A report jointly published by the United Nations Environment Programme, the WHO, the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Stockholm, Rotterdam and Basel conventions states that in the year 2012 alone, approximately 12.6 million people lost their lives due to conditions brought on by environmental pollution. UNEP also estimates that environmental degradation is behind 25 percent of all human diseases. Environmental Pollution Impact While environmental pollution may have an impact on everyone, research has shown that there are certain demographics that are more vulnerable to its effects – the young, the poor, women, the migrant workers and the elderly. In addition, diseases such as Ebola, Zika and SARS are emerging every few months and spreading because of overpopulation, too much livestock and the resultant environmental impact. In order to stop the spread of these diseases, healthy ecosystems are essential. While tackling these diseases, such ecosystems can also bring about economic development, reduction of poverty, fewer risks to human well-being and the security of knowing that resources will not run out. Mental Health Increasingly, studies conducted on mental health are relating good mental health with exposure to nature. These studies have linked reduction of the symptoms of anxiety and depression and lowered stress levels to the presence of green space close by. In fact, people who moved to urban areas that are greener were seen to have improved mental health. Water Contamination Impact This is another example of environmental pollution affecting those in the lower economic strata. In countries where the income levels are middle to low, unavailability of clean water is responsible for 58 percent of the diarrhoea cases. Contaminated water and poor hygiene and sanitation are responsible for the deaths of around 3.5 million people. They also cause the premature deaths of around 25 percent of children younger than 14 years of age. Approach to Resolution There are several areas of immediate concern, based on the connection between poor human health and environmental degradation. Some of them are: Conclusion Directly or indirectly, a healthy environment means healthy people. This is not to say that disease and malnutrition will be eliminated entirely but the incidences of these occurrences will reduce and millions of human lives will not be lost every year.  Introduction Human health or human well-being is affected by two main factors – individual traits or internal factors and ecological well-being or external factors. However, most of the time, when research is conducted on the human health condition, these two factors are investigated in isolation from each other. If one truly wants to answer the question – how does the environment affect individual health – one has to look at both factors in tandem. This becomes especially important now in light of climate change warnings and governmental indifference to them. Impact of Environment on Health The drawback with health related environmental studies or environment related health studies being conducted, especially those in the West, have narrowed their focus to concentrate on specific allergenic, infectious or toxic agents. They aren’t focusing on broader issues that cover psychological and social impacts too. Some researchers agree that when studying human health it is important to take into account the impact of the environment of the people being studied. That impact can be seen in the fact that health inequalities exist as per the geography. In fact, health is impacted by the social and physical environment. Additional research has also shown that there is a direct relationship between people’s mental health and the prevalence of green spaces; the more proximity to the green space, the better the mental health. Socio-economic Differences in Environmental Impact That the environment and human health are intertwined cannot be denied. However, that relationship works out differently in different places. In other words, depending upon where you are in the world, the immediate health concerns and the environmental factors affecting those concerns can be varied. Developing countries tend to focus more on issues such as infant mortality, malnutrition and infectious diseases. The immediate environmental concerns in these countries are sanitation, hygiene, mining, ore processing, oil production and water quality. However, when one looks at developed nations, health concerns revolve around issues such as cancer, lung disease and heart disease. These countries have economies built around industries and those industries do not dispose off their hazardous wastes responsibly, thereby contaminating nearby water bodies and soil. Considering these factors, it is no wonder that emphasis is placed more on the diseases than on the causes behind those diseases. The causes vary; the diseases may not necessarily do so. Examples of Environmental Impact on Health Globally Unfortunately, there isn’t any part of the globe that is free of environmental damage, not even the Polar Regions. If one goes looking, one will almost always find health concerns related to those environmental issues. It doesn’t help that countries such as China and India are developing very quickly. Their pace is such that environmental concerns aren’t being able to keep up with development. Untreated human waste, industrial effluents, agricultural runoff and just plain old dumping are playing havoc with the ecology in both countries. Then there are the eastern European countries, many of which are former Soviet Union states. Over the past decades, hazardous waste such as heavy metals and nitrates were dumped without any plan or precaution. The result is badly contaminated ground water and surface water, not to mention the lowered quality of soil. Some action is being taken finally where in such regions are being identified and efforts have been made to remediate, reclaim and restore the soil and surface water in such places; the effort comes too late, however, for the population that has already been exposed to these contaminants. Conclusion If one really wants to know what the environmental impact on health looks like, they need to stop looking at it in terms of discrete bubbles. They must study health disorders from an individual as well as an environmental perspective.
